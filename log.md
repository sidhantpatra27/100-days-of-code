# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 25, 2020, Monday
[comment]:##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Had an overview about the C++ Standard Template Library. Read about templates, algorithms of STL and about the vector container class. Coded four practice problems from Geeks For Geeks on STL.

**Thoughts**: I initially figured out how to proceed with studying was all pumped up. Midway through, I felt tired and towards the end I had a heavy head. I spent more time on reading the concepts rather than coding. The commitment towards the challenge helped me push myslef to achieve the target for Day 1 even though I was tired.

### Day 2: May 26, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I read about some more container classes. And I tried two coding questions today. I was able to solve the question on STL vector. But I really got stuck in the second question on STL vector of nested pairs. There was a simple boolean comparison logic which didn't strike my mind. I think it's because I have not properly understood the third parameter of sort() and the concept of sorting according to pair values. I finally referred to the solution to solve the second problem. I still made syntax mistakes which took me a couple of minutes more to submit the solution.

**Thoughts**: I was feeling very tired when I started. It was late in the evening. But then I had coffee and after reading the concepts I had my dinner. I then felt light headed and went on with solving some coding problems. I could solve the first one but the second one really got me stuck. I got very frustrated and since it was getting late I decided to view the solution. Hope this doesn't repeat often.

### Day 3: May 27, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I devoted the entire day to practice coding questions on list,stack,queues in STL(one from each). I also solved a problem on implementing a queue using array and implenting a queue using two stacks. I made silly and common mistakes such as missing out a colon, or mixing variable names and segmentation fault due to improper return types. 
I also tried out a worksheet on methods and function in Python from Jose Portilla's Udemy course. But even there I couldn't solve everything.

**Thoughts**: I had a very slow and frustrating start to the day. I could do only 5 easy level questions the entire day. So that is kinda discouraging. I had to refer to solutions more often. I need to improve. Also today really is a very frustrating day and even my temper got me today which normally doesn't happen. Maybe that affected my coding. I really gotta keep working hard and improve my standards. Right now I need to get some sleep as I could only get around 4 hours of sleep the previous day.

### Day 4: May 28, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: For most of the day I was working on the Python methods and functions worksheet from Udemy. I started learing Python from udemy a while ago and plan to finish it ASAP. That's why I'm doing it sidewise along with Competitive Coding. Today I just finished reading about the STL containers. Practiced two Basic problems on map and set container classes.

**Thoughts**: Today was a slow paced day. Kuni Mamu was here so didn't study much throughout the day. I am not following the #100DaysOfCode for Python cause I don't want to spend that much amount of time on it. Rather I plan to start #100DayOfMLCode as soon as I finish the Python tutorial.

### Day 5: May 29, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the C++ STL set of practice questions dealing with the basics of STL container classes. Tried a medium level problem on arrays and stuck in it. Deduced a logic in O[n^2] time complexity and the problem obviously asked for better. Referred to a solution in time order O[n]. Implemented it correctly(not 100% sure) and run custom test cases successfully. But it was still not accepted. Need to sort it out tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Not much thoughts for today. Could solve the basic level container class questions comparatively faster than the previous days. Got stuck in a problem which I will try to figure out tomorrow. It seems highly like an error from the submission rules side.

### Day 6: May 30, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to debug last day's problem. Solved it with the correct logic(solution from net). Attempted another similar array based question which involved optimizing time complexity while iterating and operating through the array.

**Thoughts**: Today's debugging was comparatively easy as I took help from one of my pro friends to pinpoint the source of error. Due to assignments overload I wasn't able to take on a new topic. Will look forward to learn new concepts from tomorrow.

### Day 7: May 31, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the concepts of Arrays in C/C++. Coded one easy practice problem.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite dissapointed with my progress today. I need to spend more time on coding and implementing algorithms. I need to improve my time management skill and devote more time per day on doing productivity now that I've managed to properly maintain a healthy sleep cycle and self discipline(to much extent) in my life. I can only go better from here on.

### Day 8: Jun 1, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced two problems on Arrays

**Thoughts**: Yet again dissapointed by my progress today. I don't know how to move ahead. Had assignments to submit so couldn't practice would be an excuse. I really don't feel good. I know I can be better.

### Day 9: Jun 2, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Covered array rotation, array reversal, the sliding window and prefix sum in arrays.

**Thoughts**: Covered only theory part today. I know it's against the spirit of the challenge not to write down codes, but I didn't want to refer the solutions again and again. I learnt some new things today. So I want to implement them with a cool and fresh mind tomorrow.


### Day 10: Jun 3, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced coding problems on Arrays. Basically learning to write down optimized logics which helps to decrease time and space complexities while dealing with the contagious memory locations in arrays.

**Thoughts**: Today indeed I was able to solve the practice probelms vividly with a fresh mind. I recorded my personal highest numbers of coding questions solved today. Relatively content with my progress today compared to the past days.

### Day 11: Jun 4, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced problems on finding a subarray inside an array totalling to a given sum and finding the subarray with the maximum sum(Kadane's algorithm).

**Thoughts**: Well these two problems took an entire day for me to understand and implement them. But now I've to rush to prepare for an upcoming exam in a few hours :p (Freelancing stuff).

### Day 12: Jun 5, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read the theory behind time complexity and auxiliary space. Practiced problems on re-arranging an array without using extra space and the famous Trapping rain water problem using the lower envelope technique for monotonic functions.

**Thoughts**: Like previous days I might have just covered two problems, but the amount of concepts and logics I grasped today was a significant progress for me and an improvement in my thought process.

### Day 13: Jun 6, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the concepts of searching. Practiced problems on the same.

**Thoughts**: Was busy with internship work for most part of the day. But I was still able to meet today's learning target. Had a refreshing logic building session today.

### Day 14: Jun 7, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the theory of Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Selection sort and Quick sort. Implemented the partitioning function of Quicksort.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated as I've spent more than 2 hours on Quicksort still I can't fully understand it.
