# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 25, 2020, Monday
[comment]:##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Had an overview about the C++ Standard Template Library. Read about templates, algorithms of STL and about the vector container class. Coded four practice problems from Geeks For Geeks on STL.

**Thoughts**: I initially figured out how to proceed with studying was all pumped up. Midway through, I felt tired and towards the end I had a heavy head. I spent more time on reading the concepts rather than coding. The commitment towards the challenge helped me push myslef to achieve the target for Day 1 even though I was tired.

### Day 2: May 26, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I read about some more container classes. And I tried two coding questions today. I was able to solve the question on STL vector. But I really got stuck in the second question on STL vector of nested pairs. There was a simple boolean comparison logic which didn't strike my mind. I think it's because I have not properly understood the third parameter of sort() and the concept of sorting according to pair values. I finally referred to the solution to solve the second problem. I still made syntax mistakes which took me a couple of minutes more to submit the solution.

**Thoughts**: I was feeling very tired when I started. It was late in the evening. But then I had coffee and after reading the concepts I had my dinner. I then felt light headed and went on with solving some coding problems. I could solve the first one but the second one really got me stuck. I got very frustrated and since it was getting late I decided to view the solution. Hope this doesn't repeat often.

### Day 3: May 27, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I devoted the entire day to practice coding questions on list,stack,queues in STL(one from each). I also solved a problem on implementing a queue using array and implenting a queue using two stacks. I made silly and common mistakes such as missing out a colon, or mixing variable names and segmentation fault due to improper return types. 
I also tried out a worksheet on methods and function in Python from Jose Portilla's Udemy course. But even there I couldn't solve everything.

**Thoughts**: I had a very slow and frustrating start to the day. I could do only 5 easy level questions the entire day. So that is kinda discouraging. I had to refer to solutions more often. I need to improve. Also today really is a very frustrating day and even my temper got me today which normally doesn't happen. Maybe that affected my coding. I really gotta keep working hard and improve my standards. Right now I need to get some sleep as I could only get around 4 hours of sleep the previous day.

### Day 4: May 28, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: For most of the day I was working on the Python methods and functions worksheet from Udemy. I started learing Python from udemy a while ago and plan to finish it ASAP. That's why I'm doing it sidewise along with Competitive Coding. Today I just finished reading about the STL containers. Practiced two Basic problems on map and set container classes.

**Thoughts**: Today was a slow paced day. Kuni Mamu was here so didn't study much throughout the day. I am not following the #100DaysOfCode for Python cause I don't want to spend that much amount of time on it. Rather I plan to start #100DayOfMLCode as soon as I finish the Python tutorial.

2. [C++ STL | Set 6 (set)](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/c-stl-set-6-set/1/)


### Day 5: May 29, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the C++ STL set of practice questions dealing with the basics of STL container classes. Tried a medium level problem on arrays and stuck in it. Deduced a logic in O[n^2] time complexity and the problem obviously asked for better. Referred to a solution in time order O[n]. Implemented it correctly(not 100% sure) and run custom test cases successfully. But it was still not accepted. Need to sort it out tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Not much thoughts for today. Could solve the basic level container class questions comparatively faster than the previous days. Got stuck in a problem which I will try to figure out tomorrow. It seems highly like an error from the submission rules side.

### Day 6: May 30, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to debug last day's problem. Solved it with the correct logic(solution from net). Attempted another similar array based question which involved optimizing time complexity while iterating and operating through the array.

**Thoughts**: Today's debugging was comparatively easy as I took help from one of my pro friends to pinpoint the source of error. Due to assignments overload I wasn't able to take on a new topic. Will look forward to learn new concepts from tomorrow.

### Day 7: May 31, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the concepts of Arrays in C/C++. Coded one easy practice problem.

**Thoughts**: I'm quite dissapointed with my progress today. I need to spend more time on coding and implementing algorithms. I need to improve my time management skill and devote more time per day on doing productivity now that I've managed to properly maintain a healthy sleep cycle and self discipline(to much extent) in my life. I can only go better from here on.

1. [Play with an array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/play-with-an-array/1)


### Day 8: Jun 1, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced two problems on Arrays

**Thoughts**: Yet again dissapointed by my progress today. I don't know how to move ahead. Had assignments to submit so couldn't practice would be an excuse. I really don't feel good. I know I can be better.

### Day 9: Jun 2, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Covered array rotation, array reversal, the sliding window and prefix sum in arrays.

**Thoughts**: Covered only theory part today. I know it's against the spirit of the challenge not to write down codes, but I didn't want to refer the solutions again and again. I learnt some new things today. So I want to implement them with a cool and fresh mind tomorrow.


### Day 10: Jun 3, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced coding problems on Arrays. Basically learning to write down optimized logics which helps to decrease time and space complexities while dealing with the contagious memory locations in arrays.

**Thoughts**: Today indeed I was able to solve the practice probelms vividly with a fresh mind. I recorded my personal highest numbers of coding questions solved today. Relatively content with my progress today compared to the past days.

### Day 11: Jun 4, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced problems on finding a subarray inside an array totalling to a given sum and finding the subarray with the maximum sum(Kadane's algorithm).

**Thoughts**: Well these two problems took an entire day for me to understand and implement them. But now I've to rush to prepare for an upcoming exam in a few hours :p (Freelancing stuff).

### Day 12: Jun 5, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read the theory behind time complexity and auxiliary space. Practiced problems on re-arranging an array without using extra space and the famous Trapping rain water problem using the lower envelope technique for monotonic functions.

**Thoughts**: Like previous days I might have just covered two problems, but the amount of concepts and logics I grasped today was a significant progress for me and an improvement in my thought process.

### Day 14: Jun 7, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the theory of Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Selection sort and Quick sort. Implemented the partitioning function of Quicksort.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated as I've spent more than 2 hours on Quicksort still I can't fully understand it.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Quicksort](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/quick-sort/1)


### Day 15: Jun 8, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Covered and implemented Merge sort. Solved two more coding problem. Union and Intersection of Two Sorted array.

**Thoughts**: I understood the concept of quicksort yesterday before sleeping. And so my frustration vanished. Covering merge sort was easier than I thtought. My coding practice set sail very smoothly today. I could deduce the logic.

### Day 16: Jun 9, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced two problems. One was hard level and the other easy. Was trying to implement the counting sort algo in the easy problem but it showed runtime error.

**Thoughts**: The funny thing is I was able to solve the hard problem in minutes while the easy problem took me 2-2.5 hours. I was trying to find a generalized solution but it accepted the lamest solution. Screw my life.

### Day 17: Jun 10, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the theory of strings in C++. Practiced problems on sorting and basics of strings.

**Thoughts**: I'm going way too slow and being way too lazy. I need to cut out the distraction and dedicate fixed hours towards coding.

### Day 18: Jun 11, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the naive approach of pattern searching in strings in C++. Practiced coding on strings problems. I implemented the second problem but have'nt completely understood it.

**Thoughts**: I seriously need to improve my time management skills and manage all of my workload. I have'nt understood how the ip validation problem works. I'll do it tomorrow. I am heading to prepare for test. Did I tell you I got ditched on Day 11 freelancing stuff. xD

### Day 19: Jun 12, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a few more coding problems today.

**Thoughts**: It's the same old routine every day. Frustration frustration frustration. Too hard for me to break down the logics. I don't know whether I could survive till the end by forcefully pushing myself to a field where I am still not having any interest in. I think just that I am wasting a lot of time, nearly 6-7 hours per day only on 2-3 questions. I don't quite know if at the end of day my algorithm development skill would improve or not.

### Day 20: Jun 13, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Covered the the theory of Rabin-Karp and KMP pattern searching algorithms. Practiced coding problems based on naive pattern searching in strings.

**Thoughts**: Not so frustrating today. But then again had to refer to solutions for all the problems. Also took around 2-2.5 hours. Focus and time management skill can be greatly improved.

### Day 21: Jun 14, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced two coding problems. Again referred to the solutions for solving it.

**Thoughts**: Damn these problems require simple logics but lengths of codes. Two problems took me some 2-3 hours to implement. Python makes it so much easier to implement and play with strings. But then here I'm trying to build up my logic using the C++ object oriented language. I guess it would surely help me understand algorithms right from the core.

### Day 22: Jun 15, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a problem on strings to determine if two strings were anagrams. Read about Matrix operations and practiced problems on matrix addition, multiplication and determinant calculation.

**Thoughts**: Did the strings question quickly. Another required the use of Dynamic programming, thus left it for now. Moved on two the matrix operations sections. Could implement addition and multiplication with ease. But finding the determinant took a really long time.

### Day 25: Jun 18, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started with the bit algorithms and concepts today. Practiced few problems on it.

**Thoughts**: This bit concept is so damn confusing. Will take me a couple more days to fully comprehend.

### Day 26: Jun 19, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced some basic level questions on bit operations which included binary/gray code conversion, checking if a number is power of 2 and manipulating bit difference to change a number.

**Thoughts**: Got my concepts of bit manipulation quite clear and better than the previous day. Basic level questions were easier to deal with and therefore today's practice was not much of a challenge. Although I'm building up my logic day by day.

### Day 27: Jun 20, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced the final set of problems on Bit Magic to finish the track.

**Thoughts**: Idk how but this day's progress wasn't committed or rather I might have forgotten to update. But I am updating it much later, on 28th  July, when it came to my notice. I feel those questions were difficult to implement, one of them involving high level maths.

### Day 28: Jun 21, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about recursion algorithms and practiced problems on the same.

**Thoughts**: The concept of recursion was a bit mind boggling to understand and so were to implement them in the questions. The Tower of Hanoi was especially the trickiest one.

### Day 29: Jun 22, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced two more problems on recursion - The Josephus problem and the subset generation problem.

**Thoughts**: I thought I could solve the remaining problems on recursion today, but I got stuck in these two problems. Took a couple of hours to understand and implement it.

### Day 30: Jun 23, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a final set of problems on Recursion.

**Thoughts**: So I have covered the basics algorithms and syntax of C++14. And it's been a month since I started the challenge. And surprisingly I coded for every single day no matter what. No I haven't come anywhere close to solving the actual competitive problems and neither can I guarantee to solve the problems I practiced this month. But I gained the most important thing required. Perseverance and Self-Discipline. A month back, the old me would never buy the fact that I would actually sit and code for some hours each day. But here I am ;)

### Day 32: Jun 25, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Read about the insertion and deletion operations in Linked Lists. Didn't really code anything much today. Just implemented a simple problem.

**Thoughts**: Liverpool have been crowned the Champions and I'm absolutely on top of the world. I feel so elated that I can't think about anything else let alone coding xD.

### Day 34: Jun 27, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Read about circular linked lists.

**Thoughts**: For the past couple of days haven't been highly motivated to code. Yet again it is for the sake of this challenge that I pushed myself to atleast read+code for an hour and that is the best part about this challenge. Will definitely pump up from today. There's so much to cover in Linked lists.

### Day 39: Jul 2, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented mergesort and quicksort on Doubly Linked L

**Thoughts**: I implemented them by referring to the solutions but I might need to relook the smart logic to properly grasp the concept. The dreaded Linked List track is sorta over now.

### Day 40: Jul 3, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started with Stacks today. Practiced just a simple coding question.

**Thoughts**: Did really very less today. My head is feeling very heavy. Despite gulping one full cup of coffee I don't have my concentration today. Better to start afresh tomorrow.

1. [Reverse a string using Stack](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-string-using-stack/1)


### Day 41: Jul 4, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 practice problems on Stacks which included evaluating postfix expression, sorting a stack and getting minimum of stack in O(1) time.

**Thoughts**: Started early today and tried attempting the problems first. Lack of concentration caused too much time to be devoted to the problems (6-7 hours). I can be better and more focused.

### Day 42: Jul 5, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 medium level practice problems on Stacks which included infix to postfix conversion, balanced parantheses checker and Next larger element array.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have the desired focus today but I took my time to write down the code on paper and first attempted to derive any logic without just simply thinking in the head and copying the solutions. Should do more of this henceforth.

### Day 43: Jul 6, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 medium level practice problems on Stacks which included finding Maximum rectangular area in a histogram, Max rectangle in a binary matrix and the stock span problem.

**Thoughts**: I realize I really don't remember the logic or relate the logic well to get the answers. That's what inhibited my interest in Competitive Programming in the 1st place. I really need to start debugging problems and figuring some logic on my own. I just copy because it takes an awful lot of time.

### Day 44: Jul 7, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced 1 Hard level problem.

**Thoughts**: Damn I never understand how the logics work like magic for some problems. It's so beautiful but at the same time so difficult to understand and near impossible to deduce the proper intuition behind the algorithms. (For me)

**Today's Progress**: Started with the theory of Trees and Binary trees traversal. Just theory and no coding.

**Thoughts**: I got stuck up in multiple jobs and didn't feel like coding today. Will compensate at later.


### Day 54: Jul 17, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started with practicing basic level problems on Trees.

**Thoughts**: No thoughts really. Should devote more time to coding.

1. [Deletion in a Binary Tree](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/deletion-in-a-binary-tree/1)


### Day 60: Jul 23, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced three problems on Binary Trees. Finished with the easy level problems and the only hard level problem in the track.

**Thoughts**: The hard problem was quite tough to comprehend. There was probably some logic error in my written code so it didn't run as expected. So I got frustrated after some 1+ hr of debugging and copy pasted the solution.

### Day 64: Jul 27, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Appeared for two Coding based Online Tests - SAP Labs and CodeNation

**Thoughts**: On a first glance I got nervous seeing the questions as usual. But upon re reading the questions I could eventually understand and think of some logic. I implemented the simplest of the solutions in the questions. Some questions I could fully solve and others I passed some Tcs. Will elaborate at a later date. Didn't qualify for SAP Labs and CodeNation test is to be redone.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 65: Jul 28, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Binary Search trees.

**Thoughts**: Was contacted by my Placement cell guys that I did a huge mistake by mentioning about the companies I appeared for Online Tests on social media platform. Ain't feeling nervous or guilty, but not really in a positive mood. Practiced just some beginner level questions on BST.

### Day 66: Jul 29, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a couple of problems on BST.

**Thoughts**: Couldn't start coding on time and I always leave it for late night. Anyways implemented two problems, the later one took a lot of time to understand. Also,  Hema akka got placed in SAP Labs today. Much happy. At the same time the placement time depression and anxiety is slowly catching up on my nerves.

### Day 68: Jul 31, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Attempted the Udaan Hiring challenge and a practice Placement test by Coding Ninjas.

**Thoughts**: Had been instructed to design an API for a Movie Ticket Booking system in Udaan challenge. Tried doing something. Copy pasted a code from Github. But nothing worked in the end. For the second test, couldn't solve the apti part quick enough. Took help from Internet to get answers for various output kind of questions. There were two coding questions. Tried thinking of some logic. But became too lazy to implement and run something. Was very tired by the end so couldn't continue with the BST Track.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 69: Aug 1, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Attempted the CodeNation retest and did a couple of problems to finish with the Easy questions in BST track.

**Thoughts**: The CodeNation test was really really really tough for me. Couldn't understand two of the questions in the first place. After I did tho, couldn't think of a logic. For the third question, spent almost entireity of my time in that. Still just managed to pass 7/14 Test cases and got TLE for rest. It was bad. Did manage to practice two questions of BST later in the evening. Taking a detox from social media in hope of increasing productivity.

### Day 70: Aug 2, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started with the medium level questions in BST track. Did 3 questions.

**Thoughts**: Solved the first problem quickly. The later two took some thinking and eventually referring the solution. Learnt that a function that has return type as "int" can be called without assigning the function call to an integer variable. The function just had return 0 everyhwhere. Need to check out what this actually is. (Code in Work 3)

**Today's Progress**: Finished with the medium level questions with a couple of mind boggling question. Read about a new concept - [Catalan Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-nth-catalan-number/)

**Thoughts**: Had to refer solutions for both problems. I'm feeling dizzy. Catalan Numbers was a new concept I came across. Haven't really understood the second question. Bye.

### Day 72: Aug 4, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished with the BST Track on Geeks for Geeks by practicing the final hard problem.

**Thoughts**: Started very late as I got involved in a freelancing gig. This hard problem was easy to understand and moderate level to implement. A very cool trick was used which was great thinking. Overally I think, for any tree based problem, recursion is a must.

**Today's Progress**: Practiced a couple of medium level problems from Heaps, the final medium ones in the track. 

**Thoughts**: I guess heaps revolve around just one single concept but prove to be such an important utility in bringing down time complexity. And the use of STLs makes it so much easy and fun to use.
