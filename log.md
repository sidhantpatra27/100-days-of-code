### Day 1:  21 August 2020 (Friday)
[comment]:##### (Front End Web Development)

**Today's Progress**: Implemented HTML in making a Ugly Front End ðŸ˜‚ which includes Images, Videos, Audio (with user control), Used Tables for displaying Name, Rollno, Syllabus Completed (using progress tag) and Grades expected (using meter tag). I just implemented the things which I learnt in previous sessions

**Thoughts**:I just hope after learning CSS my site will look better.
